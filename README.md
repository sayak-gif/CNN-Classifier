# CNN-Classifier
A CNN classifier using ResNet-50 is a deep learning model designed to classify brain tumors from MRI scans. With its 50-layer deep residual network, ResNet-50 effectively handles the vanishing gradient issue, enabling accurate identification and categorization of tumors, making it well-suited for analyzing complex medical imaging data.
